% ============================================================================================================================= %
% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the article.
\begin{abstract}
This project proposes to construct a neural network that will forecast energy prices in the California Independent System Operator (CISO). Accurate forecasting of energy prices in the CISO provides an economic opportunity for energy providers to incur profit and buyers to purchase at the lowest possible price. Traditional methods for forecasting have been used for many years to forecast these prices, but the recent advances in neural network time series forecasting presents a possible way to improve upon existing methods. The problem statement of this project is how to design a neural network to accurately predict stochastic energy prices.

\section{Introduction}

Instructions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide motivation to the project topic. That is tell the reader about why you want to work on this topic. Set the context and objective of the project here. 
    \item Frame the problem statement and/or the research question for your project.
    \item Summarize the contributions of your work, that is explicitly state what the expected outcomes will be. 
\end{itemize}

Outline:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Large population of California depends on energy market every day.
	\item Problem is interesting because it is data rich, and quite complex.
	\item The basic economic principle of buy-low sell-high allows a natural economic opportunity that arises to participate in the energy market with accurate forecasts.
	\item Modern advances in neural networks have shown good results in time-series forecasting (references).
	\item For the previous reason, we believe we can use neural networks to predict energy prices.
	\item Problem statement: how to construct a neural network that accurately predicts stochastic, periodic prices in the CISO.
	\item To answer this problem statement we will:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Build a time-series forecasting neural network.
		\item Benchmark the NN against existing research.
		\item We expect that a NN will perform at a higher level than existing traditional methods. 
	\end {itemize}

\subsection{Data Sources}
The dataset for this project was kindly provided by the Dowling Lab for Uncertainty Quantification and Mathematical Optimization at the University of Notre Dame in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. The dataset is comprised of over 6500 energy vendors, called nodes, participating in the California ISO. There is a full year's worth of data for each node in 2015, and price measurements are recorded at 1 hour, 15 minute, and 5 minute intervals. Latitude and longitude coordinates are known for around 2000 of these nodes for visualization purposes.

\section{Evaluation Plan}

Instructions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How will you evaluate the proposed work?
    \item What does success mean for the class project?
\end{itemize}

Outline:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluate vs. literature values.
    \item Split dataset into training and testing sets.
    \item Compare CPU time with current methods in literature.
    \item Success would be building a neural network that forecasts prices of energy markets. 
    \item Success is not if the NN beats traditional methods, but rather the testing of a new method. 
\end{itemize}
